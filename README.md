`abcli` is a library for quickly building awesome bash cli's for machine vision/deep learning applications, like [this robot](https://github.com/kamangir/blue-rvr) and [these other designs](https://github.com/kamangir/blue-bracket). `abcli` is a [`bashly`](https://github.com/DannyBen/bashly) that doesn't need a docker image to run and expands less painfully.

`abcli` supports [Amazon EC2 instances](https://github.com/kamangir/awesome-bash-cli/wiki/ec2), [Jetson Nano](https://github.com/kamangir/awesome-bash-cli/wiki/Jetson-Nano), [macOS](https://github.com/kamangir/awesome-bash-cli/wiki/macOS), and  [Raspberry Pi](https://github.com/kamangir/awesome-bash-cli/wiki/Raspberry-Pi).
