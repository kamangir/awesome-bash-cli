`abcli` is a library for quickly building awesome bash cli's for machine vision/deep learning applications, like [this robot](https://github.com/kamangir/blue-rvr) and [these other designs](https://github.com/kamangir/blue-bracket). `abcli` is a [`bashly`](https://github.com/DannyBen/bashly) that doesn't need a docker image to run and expands less painfully.

To see the list of `abcli` commands type in:

```
abcli ?

`abcli` supports Ubuntu and macOS. Raspberry Pi and Jetson Nano support are work in progress. To install `abcli` first [set up Linux](https://github.com/kamangir/awesome-bash-cli/wiki/setting-up-Linux) then use either the [manual method](#manual-install) or the [seed](https://github.com/kamangir/awesome-bash-cli/wiki/install-through-the-seed).

to configure `abcli` use [these instructions](./bash/bootstrap/config/README.md).
