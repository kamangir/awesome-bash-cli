# abcli plugins

An `abcli` plugin is a mechanism to quickly build a bash cli around existing code to automate parameter selection and other tasks. Here are eamples for `abcli` plugins:

1. A low-cost rover that carries a camera, runs deep learning vision models through python and TensorFlow, and is cloud-connected: [blue-rvr](https://github.com/kamangir/blue-rvr)
1. Multiple machine vision & ai designs on raspberry pi and jetson nano on the edge: [blue-bracket](https://github.com/kamangir/blue-bracket)
1. An art installation: [rv22](https://github.com/kamangir/RAW-Vancouver-PORTAL-2022).

To build an `abcli` plugin you need existing code or code under development that is executed through the command line.
